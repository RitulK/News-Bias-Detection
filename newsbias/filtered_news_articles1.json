        "content": "Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (File photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: In a Cabinet press briefing on Wednesday, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the government has decided to include a caste survey in the main census.\"Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs has decided today that Caste enumeration should be included in the forthcoming census,\" said Ashiwini Vaishnaw.The minister also attacked the Congress party for \"opposing\" the caste census, claiming that late Dr Manmohan Singh had said in 2010 that \"the matter of caste census should be considered in the Cabinet\".\"Congress governments have always opposed the caste census. In 2010, the late Dr Manmohan Singh said that the matter of caste census should be considered in the Cabinet. A group of ministers was formed to consider this subject. Most of the political parties have recommended a caste census,\" he said.Vaishnaw, in a jab at the Congress party, said some state governments have conducted caste surveys from \"a political angle in a non-transparent way\". The minister's remark was in reference to surveys conducted in Congress-ruled Telangana and Karnataka.\"It is well understood that Congress and its INDI alliance partners have used the caste census only as a political tool. Some states have conducted surveys to enumerate castes. While some states have done this well, some others conducted such surveys only from a political angle in a non-transparent way. Such surveys created doubts in society. To ensure that our social fabric is not disturbed by politics, caste enumeration should be included in the census instead of surveys,\" the minister said.\"As per Article 246 of the Constitution of India, the subject of Census is listed at number 69 in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule, making it a Union subject. While some states have conducted caste-based surveys, the approach has varied significantly. In certain cases, these surveys have been carried out in a transparent and organised manner, while in others, they have appeared to serve political motives, lacking transparency and raising doubts in society. Such inconsistent efforts have the potential to disrupt social harmony,\" said the minister.\"Taking these concerns into account, and to ensure that the social fabric remains intact, the government has decided that caste enumeration should be conducted transparently as part of the official Census, rather than through fragmented state-level surveys. This move is aimed at strengthening the social and economic foundations of the country while continuing its path of development,\" he added.",

John James.\"This guy, he said, he said, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to start the impeachment of Donald Trump.

Mr. Das, a former ISKCON leader and spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatani Jagran Jote was arrested on November 25 at Dhaka airport. He was charged for insulting the national flag of Bangladesh.\n\nAfter a lower court rejected his application for bail, he applied in the High Court where the order was passed by a bench of Justice Md Atoar Rahman and Justice Md Ali Reza.\n\nHis arrest had sparked protests, culminating in violent clashes between his followers and law enforcement outside the Chattogram Court Building on November 27, which resulted in the death of a lawyer, and further strained relations between India and Bangladesh.\n\nAs President of Pundarik Dham, Mr Das has long been a voice for those seeking religious freedom and minority protection. He previously held the position of divisional organising secretary for ISKCON in Chattogram but ISKCON Bangladesh said that he had been removed from all positions in the organisation.\n\nHe was born in May 1985 in Karianagar village, located in the Satkania Upazila of Chattogram. Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari gained recognition for his skills as a child orator within religious circles. His spiritual journey began at a young age, and by 1997, at just 12 years old, he took diksha (initiation) and joined ISKCON as a brahmachari.\n\nIn response to Brahmachari's arrest last year, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India had expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the court's decision to deny him bail in January. An MEA statement emphasised that the arrest occurred against the backdrop of widespread violence against Hindus and other minority communities in Bangladesh. The MEA pointed out that these attacks, including arson, looting of minority-owned properties, theft, vandalism, and desecration of temples and deities, have continued unchecked. It was noted that despite these attacks, religious leaders like Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who advocate for peaceful change, are facing charges, while the perpetrators of violence remain unpunished.\n\n",

ICP is a partner of Just Rights for Children (JRC) - a network of over 200 NGOs working in 416 districts for child protection and child rights.\n\nICP conducted the research with data from other JRC partners in these states including Anekal Rehabilitation Education and Development Centre, Margdarshi Society, Spandana Association, Prayas JAC Society, Janakalyan Welfare Society, Rural Education and Liberty, SAMANTHA Society for Rural Education and Development Society for Education and Environment Development.\n\nExpressing optimism about this positive trend, Ravi Kant, National Convenor of Just Rights for Children, stated, \"This finding is extremely encouraging for the country and a strong indication that India is on the right path to eliminating child labour. The steady decline in child labour across these three states reflects the effectiveness of recent policy initiatives and the commitment of the state and Central governments to end this crime. Now, we must ensure sustained efforts from all stakeholders - including government agencies, civil society, and industry leaders - to build on this momentum and achieve a child labour-free India.\"\n\nTo assess the extent of child labour in this sector, specific pockets in the states were identified which included Chikkaballapur and Kolar districts in Karnataka, Gaya in Bihar, and Alluri Seetha Rama Raju, Anakapalli, Chittoor and Sri Satya Sai districts in Andhra Pradesh. The data was collated after visits and consultations with stakeholders, engagement with residents and community leaders for geographical insights and data received from residents in the areas. Various researchers have found that inhaling dust, toxic chemicals and heavy metals present in incense sticks leads to respiratory and neurological effects, cardiovascular problems, cognitive dysfunction and potential long-term health issues like cancer.\n\nWhile this overall positive trend is visible across all study states, the trend showed regional variations. While in Bihar, an overwhelming 96 per cent of respondents said they had not witnessed any child labour in their neighbourhood incense stick industry, 61 per cent of Karnataka respondents had not seen any child labour in their neighbourhood factories and 77 per cent of respondents in Andhra Pradesh said that child labour did not exist in the incense stick factories around them.",

A reduction in FRP by \u20b93.46 per quintal will be for every 0.1% decrease in recovery rate.\n\nThe government has also decided that there will not be any deduction in case of sugar mills where recovery is below 9.5%. Such farmers will get \u20b9329.05 per cent for sugarcane in the ensuing 2025-26 season.\n\nAccording to the statement, the cost of production of sugarcane for the sugar season 2025-26 is \u20b9173 per quintal. The FRP of \u20b9355 per quintal fixed for 2025-26 at a recovery rate of 10.25% is higher by 105.2% over production cost.\n\nThe sugar sector is an important agro-based sector that impacts the livelihood of about five crore sugarcane farmers and their dependents and around five lakh workers directly employed in sugar mills, apart from those employed in various ancillary activities including farm labour and transportation.\n\nThe FRP has been determined on the basis of recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and after consultation with state governments and other stakeholders.\n\nAs of April 28, about 87% of total cane dues of \u20b997,270 crore have been paid to farmers in the 2024-25 season, while 99.92% of total cane dues of \u20b91,11,782 crores were paid to farmers for 2024-25.",

        "content": "United States President Donald Trump on April 29 has again taken jabs at Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for his economic policies, while touting his own tariffs policy during a rally to mark his 100th day in office, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nSpeaking at the rally near Detroit, Michigan, Donald Trump blasted Jerome Powell saying: \u201cInflation is basically down and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person who\u2019s not really doing a good job.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to criticise the Fed. You\u2019re supposed to let him do his own thing \u2014 but I know much more than he does about interest rates,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018Give Them Time Before Slaughter\u2019, Says Donald Trump Donald Trump went on to tout his tariffs policy, calling it a flexible move aimed at giving companies time to comply before action is taken. He said tariffs are \u201ca little flexibility\u201d designed to offer companies time to move their manufacturing back to the US and warned: \u201cWe gave them a little bit of time before we slaughter them.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump's Repeats Attacks on Jerome Powell The attacks came even after earlier in April Donald Trump said despite his criticisms over Jerome Powell's pace on interest rate cuts, he would not fire the central bank chief, the report noted.\n\nHis clarification came after already volatile markets (shaken by Trump tariffs) tumbled more over liklihood of Jerome Powell being replaced.\n\nDonald Trump Calls Plummeting Popularity in Surveys \u2018Biased\u2019 Donald Trump also addressed falling popularity in various polls on his economic agenda, calling them \u201cbiased\u201d. He also framed tariffs as \u201cnecessary\u201d ahead of his planned tax cuts legislation, which would remove income tax on tips, overtime pay and social security.\n\nHe also warned about possible Republican detractors, saying they should be challenged if they fail to support his agenda. \u201cRemember who those grandstanders are and vote them the hell out of office,\u201d Donald Trump said.\n\nDonald Trump's 100th Day Rally in Michigan \u2014 Highlights Donald Trump's 100 Days event marked the fabled benchmark of early presidential success before an audience caught squarely in the middle of his campaign to overhaul global trade and rebuild the US industrial base.\n\nMacomb County \u2014 which split 56 per cent for Trump in the 2024 presidential race \u2014 is emblematic of many former Democratic, blue-collar strongholds that were receptive to the president\u2019s economic promises on the campaign trail. Winning those areas helped him easily return to the White House, sweeping all seven swing states and securing the popular vote.\n\nMany residents in places like suburban Detroit \u2014 home to plants tied to General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV \u2014 have championed Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policy, seizing on his promises of revitalised domestic manufacturing and the resurgence of good-paying factory jobs.\n\nBut automakers are warning that stiff levies could cause plant shutdowns and job losses instead.\n\nAuto Plants: It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the changes announced Tuesday would be enough to restart production halted in the wake of Trump\u2019s earlier import duty announcements. Stellantis had previously paused production to adapt to the changes, causing temporary layoffs in Michigan and Indiana, as well as at a Canadian plant across the Detroit River.\n\nAnother potential test case for Trump lies just down the road at Stellantis\u2019 Warren Truck Assembly Pant, where workers build the company\u2019s Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs. Sales have been underwhelming, and output was temporarily halted this month because of a shortage of engines, with a restart expected in early May.\n\nThe United Auto Workers, whose president Shawn Fain has praised Trump\u2019s automotive tariffs, has pointed to Warren as evidence that Stellantis has capacity to build more cars and trucks in the US \u2014 and summon laid-off members back to work.\n\nDoug King, 30-year-old Stellantis employee attending Trump\u2019s rally, said he was excited by the president\u2019s trade vision and believes a boost to US manufacturing will happen \u201cquicker than you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hurt the companies. He\u2019s trying to save the companies,\u201d King said. \u201cHe\u2019ll tweak deals \u2014 he\u2019ll tweak everything \u2014 to make it work.\u201d\n\nTrump told rallygoers his tariffs \u201chaven\u2019t even really kicked in yet,\u201d but reiterated his belief he\u2019d be able to broker deals even with countries such as China that thus far have refused to engage in serious negotiations. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d Trump said.\n\nApproval Rating: Trump\u2019s 100-day victory lap comes despite polls showing his approval ratings sinking to the lowest level in decades for presidents at this milestone in their terms. Those marks have been driven down over concerns about his handling of the economy and fears of a potential recession.\n\nJust 39% of respondents in an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll said they approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president, while a CNN survey marked a 41% approval rating.\n\nImmigration remains an area of relative strength for the Republican president who has intensified the government effort to deter border crossings and deport foreign nationals in the US illegally.\n\nTrump\u2019s second term has also been marked by a campaign to rapidly remake the government, with billionaire Elon Musk leading a sweeping effort to slash federal spending and downsize the workforce.\n\nThe president has moved at breakneck speed to overhaul federal policy, having issued scores of executive orders setting in motion regulatory shifts and other changes on subjects ranging from appliance standards and artificial intelligence, to communications and coal.\n\nTrump is also presiding over a broad effort to overhaul Washington\u2019s relationships overseas, having renewed his first-term push for European allies to boost NATO contributions, while demanding free passage for US vessels at the Panama Canal, discussing a potential acquisition of Greenland and musing about how Canada should serve as the 51st US state.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech followed a visit to Selfridge Air National Guard Base with Michigan\u2019s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Later this week, the president is set to deliver a commencement address at the University of Alabama.",

A previous attempt to clinch the minerals deal fell through earlier this year after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office.\n\nBoth sides overcame a key hurdle last week, when they agreed that the previously provided US aid to Kyiv won\u2019t be calculated into the future economic partnership deal between the two countries, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Sunday.\n\nThe push for the US-Ukraine minerals deal comes as the White House struggles to get Russia to agree to end Moscow\u2019s three-year-long war on its neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to make maximalist demands, insisting that Russia must take control of four regions of Ukraine it doesn\u2019t fully occupy as part of any agreement to end his war, Bloomberg News reported earlier.\n\nLeavitt reiterated that Trump was getting frustrated with the difficulty in both Ukraine and Russia agreeing to a peace deal, but that \u201che remains optimistic that we can get this done.\u201d\n\nWith assistance from Piotr Skolimowski, Daryna Krasnolutska, Daniel Flatley and Hadriana Lowenkron.\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Squabbles between Spain\u2019s minority government and opposition parties are muddling efforts to find out and explain what caused a massive blackout that left Spain, Portugal and parts of France in the dark on Monday.\n\nWhile Spanish grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica gathered millions of data points in a highly technical probe to determine what caused about two thirds of the country\u2019s power supply to disappear from the grid, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez drew the political battle lines of the blame game that\u2019s already brewing, pushing back against claims that his government\u2019s expansion of wind and solar was at fault.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a problem of an excess of renewables,\u201d he told the media on Tuesday. Political rivals who are linking the network\u2019s vulnerability to a Socialist-led withdrawal from nuclear power are \u201ceither lying or showing their ignorance.\u201d\n\nWidespread confusion and a lack of clear leadership in the aftermath of a nationwide event aren\u2019t new in Spain. Last October, a muddled response from local, regional and state authorities to unprecedented rains that killed over 200 people in Valencia led to such outrage that politicians on both sides of the aisle and even King Felipe II had actual mud thrown at them when they visited hard-hit villages.\n\nThe door to more frustration was opened as the causes for the worst outage in Europe in years remain murky more than 24 hours after millions were plunged into darkness.\n\nThe clearest response came from Red El\u00e9ctrica, which pointed a rapid combination of events over a five-second span. On Monday, with Spaniards reeling, technical personnel from the grid operator spoke to the public just over two hours after the power went out, while S\u00e1nchez appeared almost three hours later.\n\n\u201cMore than 20 hours have gone by and we have no explanation of what happened,\u201d Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, leader of the conservative People\u2019s Party, told local media. \u201cThe impression we are giving is disgraceful.\u201d\n\nThe hours of silence stoked fears of a cyberattack from a foreign power. It wasn\u2019t until Tuesday morning that Red El\u00e9ctrica ruled that option out, based on preliminary analysis done with national cyber and security agencies.\n\nThat didn\u2019t alleviate the confusion, as Sanchez said it was too soon to tell when the cause might be, and a judge on the country\u2019s national court opened an investigation, saying \u201ccyber terrorism is among the possibilities.\u201d\n\nSanchez himself was asked about the likelihood that the blackout had been caused by a cyber attack at a press conference in Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt would be foolish to rule out any hypothesis,\u201d the prime minister said, despite insisting that renewables weren\u2019t to blame. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling it out, I\u2019m not pointing to it.\u201d\n\nSanchez is a polarizing figure in Spain after almost seven years, during which he\u2019s managed to survive at the head of increasingly fragile coalitions through skillful maneuvering and, at times, seeking to demonize his conservative opponents. Last year, he threatened to quit politics over a criminal probe of his wife\u2019s business affairs which he decried as a right-wing stitch-up.\n\nThe blackout on Monday shone an uncomfortable spotlight on the Sanchez government\u2019s controversial position on phasing out nuclear power at a time when many countries are extending the lives of reactors or planning to build new ones. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o said nuclear plants need to be retained as \u201cbackup power\u201d for volatile solar and wind capacity.\n\nIn the meantime, experts are trying to gather the facts about what happened, and Portugal isn\u2019t waiting for Spain and plans to request an independent audit of the incident from the European Union.\n\nThe longer the uncertainty persists, the more pressure Sanchez will face. Experts are already at odds about the role that solar and wind played. Spain had reported an unprecedented number of hours with negative power prices in recent months, a fallout from insufficient storage capacity available to soak up increasing amounts of solar and wind supply.\n\nSolar farms in particular inject large amounts of power into the grid during the day and go dark at night. While these swings can create instability for the grid, the variations haven\u2019t previously caused blackouts in the country.\n\nFor critics of renewables, the blackout represents an opportunity to go the attack. They\u2019ve argued that limited fossil-fueled generation in Spain meant there was insufficient inertia to help maintain the grid\u2019s frequency. But that ignores the other sources of stabilizing inertia available, including nuclear, hydro and solar thermal.\n\n\u201cA lack of inertia was therefore not the main driver for the blackout,\u201d said Adam Bell, a power analyst in the UK. \u201cIndeed, post the frequency event no fossil generation remained online \u2014 but wind, solar and hydro did.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, just after noon and again about 15 minutes before the outage, the frequency of the grid started shifting unusually, indicating that the grid was under stress and needed to be stabilized, according to data provided to Bloomberg by Gridradar.\n\nOne clear lesson is that more investment is needed to ensure resilience of the system. More battery storage would have definitely helped as the technology could have responded \u201cin a split second,\u201d said Kesavarthiniy Savarimuthu, an analyst with BloombergNEF.\n\nOther European nations are watching closely, as they could face similar issues as the continent transition to clean energy to protect environment but also reduce dependencies on fossil fuel exporters.\n\n\u201cThe massive blackout here in Spain and Portugal is a brutal reminder of the importance of security of supply,\u201d Ebba Busch, Sweden\u2019s energy minister, said in a post on social media. \u201cRenewables and more grids alone will not build the strong power system that the EU needs for our security and our competitiveness.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Daniel Basteiro, Thomas Gualtieri, Macarena Mu\u00f1oz, William Mathis, John Ainger and Rachel Morison.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

The so-called Trump Gold Card offers residency and a path to citizenship to investors who pay $5 million to the US treasury.

The required investments also include buying a house, and voluntary donations are encouraged. As an EU nation, Maltese passports grant holders the freedom to live and work anywhere inside the 27-member bloc.\n\nThe Mediterranean island is one of a handful of European countries that have over recent years offered golden visas and passports, which gained popularity during the European debt crisis when nations started selling residency to attract foreign investment.\n\nPortugal, Ireland, Greece, Hungary had in recent years also launched such programs for the wealthy to get their hands on much-prized EU freedom of movement.

        "content": "An Australian woman has sparked a debate on social media after posting a video on Instagram discussing cultural differences between India and the West, particularly Indian professionals' dependence on domestic help for household chores.\n\nShe also mentioned that people in India lack work-life balance.\n\nWhat did the Australian woman say? Along with the video, Bree Steele, a podcast producer, wrote in her Instagram post: \u201cChores? Hardly know \u2018em! This is one of the least talked-about cultural differences between India and the West.\u201d\n\nComparing daily life in India with the West, Steele said that in the West, most people manage cooking and household chores alongside full-time jobs.\n\nBut, in India, most families have domestic workers for such tasks. \u201cI don't cook or clean in India. Chores? I don't know them,\u201d she said in her video.\n\n\u201cMost middle-class to wealthy households in India have house help. Most people have someone who does their cleaning, maybe their washing and cooking,\u201d she added.\n\nSteele further said: \u201cI was like, that's what we do in the west. We do everything ourselves with full-time jobs.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that Indian professionals work for longer hours as compared to their counterparts in the West, the podcast producer said: \u201cOver time, I've observed that my friends get work calls at like 9.30 in the night, and there's no work-life balance here. The expectation on corporate workers is just so high that if you're single, of course you don't have time to do your own cooking and cleaning (sic).\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for better or for worse, labour is cheap in India, so it makes sense that everyone has their own house help,\u201d she added.\n\nConcluding her video, Steele admitted that she feels \u201cashamed\u201d at how much she enjoys not having to cook or clean every day.\n\nSocial media reactions In reaction to Steele\u2019s video, users on social media were divided. While some agreed with her, others expressed different opinions.\n\nHere are some reactions:\n\n\u201cWhat a keen observation and so well expressed, my girl!! It\u2019s really not talked about enough, but you\u2019ve nailed both sides!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, y\u2019all have machines: dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, etc. Also, it\u2019s very dusty here, so we have to clean our floors every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel we have it easy in India, and yet I don\u2019t know why we keep chasing Western standards. But maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019ve always seen the glamourised end of it, never the hard-hitting reality. Thanks for putting it out here. I hope you're having fun in India.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs someone who grew up in India with so-called privileges and then moved to the West and does all the chores, I\u2019ll pick the West every single time. Despite the chores, I still have a LOT of spare time that I spend on my hobbies and health. Despite all the help in India, I lived an unhealthy and tired life.\u201d",

Abraham is a 1982-batch IAS officer of Kerala cadre, who has been the chief secretary of the state too. Abraham is also a former whole-time member of the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n\nSince May 2021, Abraham has been attached to the Chief Minister\u2019s Office (CMO). In 2024, the Vijayan government accorded Cabinet rank to Abraham, making him even more powerful than a serving chief secretary of the state.\n\nAbraham shot to the limelight for the first time many years ago. As a whole-time director of SEBI from 2008-2011, Abraham, the then in charge of secondary markets, probed the Sahara India investor fraud scandal about raising funds from the stock market. Abraham directed the Sahara Group to refund the money mobilised from investors. His direction was later upheld by the Supreme Court of India.\n\nAbraham holds an MTech degree from IIT-Kanpur and a PhD degree from the University of Michigan in the US. During his service as IAS officer, he was posted with the Kerala's finance department. During the Congress regime in Kerala (2011-2016), Abraham served as additional chief secretary for finance. Even after the Vijayan-led Left government came to power, Abraham continued at the helm of the finance department. He became the chief secretary in 2017.\n\nIn the news as CEO of KIIFB Abraham has been in the news recently as CEO of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board or KIIFB, floated in 2016 to mobilise funds from the open market to invest in infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, the ED registered a case against KIIFB alleging violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in connection with raising \u20b9 2,150 crore masala bonds listed on the London Stock Market. The ED served a summons to Abraham, among others, in the case.\n\nThe petitioner in the now-stayed CBI case alleged Abraham, during service, acquired an apartment worth \u20b93 crore in Mumbai, another apartment worth \u20b91 crore at Thycaud in Thiruvananthapuram and constructed a three-storey shopping complex at Kadappakkada in Kollam district worth \u20b98 crore.\n\nThe FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act cannot be registered without mandatory sanction under Section 17A of the law.\n\nAbraham has denied all the allegations.",

In 2010, the late Dr Manmohan Singh said that the matter of caste census should be considered in the Cabinet. A group of ministers was formed to consider this subject,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost of the political parties have recommended a caste census.

It is well understood that Congress and its INDI alliance partners have used the caste census only as a political tool,\u201d Vaishnaw was quoted as saying in the report.\n\n\u201cSome states have conducted surveys to enumerate castes. While some states have done this well, some others conducted such surveys only from a political angle in a non-transparent way. Such surveys created doubts in society. To ensure that our social fabric is not disturbed by politics, caste enumeration should be included in the census instead of surveys,\u201d he added.\n\nThe population survey, which is conducted once every decade, was due in 2021, but was delayed by the pandemic and technical and logistical hurdles.\n\nWhat is Caste Census? Just like a national census collects data on the age, gender, and demographical composition, a caste census is a population survey that collects data on the caste composition of a region or a country.\n\nIndia has published caste data (from 1951 to 2011) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only. In October 2023, findings of Bihar's caste survey were released by then state CM Nitish Kumar. The survey had said that Other Backward Classes and Extremely Backward Classes constituted 63 per cent of the state's total population.\n\nThe EBCs (36 per cent) were the largest social segment in Bihar followed by the OBCs at 27.13 per cent.\n\nKarnataka's original caste census report 'missing\u2019? The BJP in Karnataka on Tuesday alleged that the original caste census report, prepared by the state government is missing, and claimed that it was currently with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.\n\nAccording to a PTI report, the BJP, along with some ruling party MLAs, raised some concerns over the alleged shortcomings in the original socio-economic and educational survey report, also referred to as the caste census report.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly R Ashoka had alleged that the entire report was \"bogus\" and called for a judicial probe into it. He further alleged that the original report is with the CM.\n\nHe was referring to the purported letter written to the government by former chairperson of the Karnataka State Backward Commission K Jayaprakash Hegde stating that the original copy of the caste census report was not available.",

        "content": "Indian courts can, under limited circumstances, modify arbitral awards, ruled a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday. So far, Indian courts could only uphold or set them aside.\n\nThe five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, ruled that courts can modify arbitral awards in accordance with Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Section 34 allows parties to apply for setting aside an arbitral award, while Section 37 deals with appeals against such orders.\n\nThe other four members of the bench hearing Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd were Justices B.R. Gavai, Sanjay Kumar, K.V. Viswanathan, and Augustine George Masih.\n\nThe apex court clarified that courts can do so in rare instances, such as correcting calculation errors, adjusting interest, or making other simple changes, without nullifying the entire award. In exceptional cases, Article 142 of the Constitution can also be invoked, but only in a limited manner.\n\nJustice K.V. Viswanathan dissented. He expressed concerns about the court\u2019s authority to modify post-award interest and use Article 142 for such modifications, suggesting that any necessary changes should be handled by remitting the matter back to the arbitral tribunal.\n\nThe majority ruling can reshape India's arbitration landscape, as it eliminates the need for businesses to re-arbitrate disputes from scratch, reducing costs and delays.\n\nAlso Read: Supreme Court could reshape arbitration. Businesses are watching. At the same time, the ruling could also lead to more litigation, undermining the utility of arbitration as an alternative to court battles.\n\nThe case diary Gayatri Balasamy, a senior executive at ISG Novasoft Technologies, resigned in 2005, alleging sexual harassment by chief executive Krishna Srinivasan. The company did not accept her resignation and instead issued three termination letters. Balasamy filed criminal complaints, while ISG countered with defamation and extortion charges.\n\nThe dispute went to arbitration, where the tribunal awarded Balasamy \u20b92 crore in compensation. She challenged the award in the Madras high court, claiming it ignored key parts of her case. In 2014, a single judge increased the award by \u20b91.6 crore. However, in 2019, a division bench reduced the award drastically to \u20b950,000, calling the increase excessive.\n\nBalasamy appealed to the Supreme Court, which in 2024 referred the issue of judicial power to modify arbitral awards to the five-judge Constitution Bench.\n\nAlso Read: India's bid to be arbitration hub hit by mediator council delay The top court ruling comes as the Union law ministry considers amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Public consultations on a draft bill closed last November.\n\nExperts believe that granting courts greater power over arbitration outcomes may push businesses to adjust their dispute resolution strategies, potentially favouring arbitration hubs such as Singapore, London, or Dubai over India to minimise legal uncertainty.\n\nCountries like the UK, US, and Singapore already allow courts to adjust domestic arbitration awards, but India's legal framework does not distinguish between domestic and international arbitration, treating both types of cases the same.",

The grant of bail does not mean the power to influence witnesses. In the past, you have influenced witnesses,\" the bench had said.The top court, as a result, offered him a choice.\"So, you have to choose between the post and the freedom. Such drastic findings are recorded against you in your capacity as a minister,\" the bench had said while hearing pleas to recall Balaji's bail on the ground that he influenced witnesses in the case.Balaji was sworn in as a minister by Ravi on September 29, 2024, after being granted bail by the SC. He had earlier resigned in February 2024, months after remaining as a minister without portfolio in the wake of his June 2023 arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Upon his re-induction last year, he was assigned the same key portfolios \u2014 electricity, non-conventional energy development, prohibition, and excise that he held previously in the Stalin cabinet.Ponmudy, a senior DMK leader, had courted a major controversy recently over his Shaivite-Vaishnavite remarks made in the context of a sex worker, drawing widespread criticism, even as the Madras High Court later initiated proceedings on its own on the matter.Though he had been removed from a key party post, there were demands from opposition parties and other quarters for his ouster from the cabinet.Transport Minister S S Sivasankar will handle the Electricity portfolio, held by Senthil Balaji. Further, Housing Minister S Muthusamy has been allotted Excise and Prohibition, held by Senthil Balaji.RS Rajakannappan has been allotted Ponmudy's Forests and Khadi, in addition to his existing Milk and Dairy Development portfolio, the release said.Further, the Governor has accepted the CM's recommendation to include Padmanabhapuram MLA T Mano Thangaraj in the cabinet, it said. He was dropped in an earlier cabinet rejig.The swearing-in of the minister designate will be held at 6 PM on Monday, it added.Responding to the development, principal opposition party AIADMK said Ponmudy stepping down was a victory for its various protests against him.Balaji's exit was a \"justice\" ensured through the court, it said on its official 'X' handle.BJP state vice-president Narayanan Thirupathy said, \"Removal of Senthil Balaji & Ponmudi from Tamil Nadu ministry is expected, though late.\" \"It is not a shame on them but on Chief Minister MK Stalin for his misrule, corrupt government, maladministration and mismanagement,\" he said in a social media update.",

(A grab from the livestream of the IMEC summit in Mumbai on April 28).\n\n2 / 9\n\nThe new policy aims to take Maharashtra\u2019s share of shipbuilding and repair capacity within India from 11% to 33% by 2030. It will promote dedicated shipyards, and ship recycling, facilities, and build a favourable ecosystem by leveraging the state\u2019s coastal infrastructure.

The policy encourages private sector participation through transparent land allotments by the Maharashtra Maritime Board and offers land at concessional rates or long-term leases to incentivise investment. File image: Chowgule shipyard\n\n4 / 9\n\nThe government will also focus on building strategic infrastructure such as integrated maritime clusters, modern dry docks, and support facilities. It also promises to simplify approvals, ensure water, electricity, and road connectivity, and support green recycling in line with international environmental standards.\n\n5 / 9\n\nBy 2030, the policy aims to attract \u20b96,600 crore in investment and generate over 40,000 jobs. This figure is projected to rise sharply by 2047, with anticipated investments of \u20b918,000 crore and over 3.3 lakh new employment opportunities in the maritime sector. Stock image source: Canva\n\n6 / 9\n\nMaking India one of the top 10 shipbuilding nations by 2030, and one of the top five by 2047, is the government\u2019s stated goal. China, Japan, and South Korea own over 93% of all the ships in the world. India ranks 21st globally in building ships. However, the country ranks second in ship recycling with a 32.6% share. Stock image source: Canva\n\n7 / 9\n\nTo address these, the Union government has already set aside \u20b925,000 crore under the Maritime Development Fund and provided \u20b94,000 crore under the shipbuilding support policy from 2016 to 2026. Indian ships are also now given preference in tenders and charters, along with tax reliefs. Stock image source: Canva\n\n8 / 9\n\nWhile the opportunities in the shipbuilding ecosystem are vast, the challenges are equally complex. Low labour productivity, a lack of ancillary industries, limited capital, and outdated technology have all held back India\u2019s progress in this sector.

        "content": "The Reserve Bank of India's plan to buy \u20b91.25 lakh crore ($14.66 billion) of bonds in May will likely lower the cost of overnight interbank funds, effectively acting as a rate cut, according to analysts.The debt purchases are likely to increase the liquidity in the banking system, helping transmit the two rate cuts announced this year and also keep the effective cost of funds below the policy repo rate of 6.00%.When the RBI buys bonds, it injects liquidity into the banking system, making it cheaper for lenders to borrow from each other overnight. This reduces overnight interbank lending rates, which are key short-term interest rates in the economy.The RBI, under Governor Sanjay Malhotra, who took charge in December, has flooded the banking system with liquidity. The bond purchase plan in May will follow purchases of \u20b91.20 lakh crore in April and 2.83 trillion rupees in January-March.The central bank is targeting bond purchases amounting to a surplus of around 1% of deposits, Malhotra said earlier this month, which works out to about 2.30 trillion rupees to 2.50 trillion rupees.The weighted average overnight call money rate was at 5.93% on Tuesday (April 29) but is expected to ease to 5.75%, the rate offered by the RBI to banks parking excess funds at the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF).Indian government bond yields declined on Tuesday after the May debt purchase plan was announced, with the 10-year bond yield hitting a low of 6.32%, after rising to 6.40% a day prior.With sufficient domestic liquidity, we can expect the weighted average call rate to fall further and align closely to the SDF rate, said Aditi Gupta, economist at Bank of Baroda.It seems that for now, the RBI's intent is to target the quantum of durable liquidity and take it to at least 1% of deposits, with enough tolerance for higher values, Samiran Chakraborty, Citi's India chief economist, said.",

        "content": "Iran will hold talks in Rome on Friday with European parties to their now moribund 2015 nuclear deal, its foreign minister said on Wednesday, as both sides seek to position themselves ahead of a new round of US-Iranian negotiations on Saturday.Reuters reported on Monday that Tehran had proposed meeting Britain, France and Germany, collectively known as the E3, who stuck to the 2015 deal meant to curb Iran's nuclear activity, which unravelled in 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump walked out of it during his first term in the White House.\"In my opinion, the three European countries have lost their role (in the nuclear file) due to the wrong policies they have adopted. Of course, we do not want this and are ready to hold talks with them in Rome,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told state media on Wednesday.There was initial hesitation within the E3 over concern that such talks could create a parallel track and hijack the negotiations pursued by Trump's second administration that Washington says aim to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.But three European diplomats told Reuters that the E3 decided it was ultimately in their interest to maintain dialogue with Iran and reaffirm how they envisaged the parameters of a new nuclear deal.Foreign ministry political directors were meeting US officials in Berlin on Wednesday to be briefed on previous rounds of US-Iranian talks and prepare for the Rome meeting, and will head there on Friday, two diplomats said.Iran is looking to build on the momentum of nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration that resumed in Oman on Saturday and after its talks with Russia and China last week. US and Iranian negotiators will reconvene in Rome on Saturday.Iran's approach to the E3 suggests it is keeping its options open but also wants to assess where the Europeans stand on the possible reimposition of United Nations sanctions against Tehran before October, known in diplomatic circles as the \"snapback mechanism\", when a resolution ratifying the 2015 accord expires.Relations between the E3 and Iran have worsened over the last year despite sporadic meetings since last September against a backdrop of new sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic over its ballistic missile programme, its detention of foreign citizens and support for Russia in its war against Ukraine.Highlighting those tensions, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Tuesday that Paris would not think twice if the current negotiations failed about launching the snapback of sanctions, which he said would have \"devastating effects.\u201dHe accused Tehran of being on the cusp of covertly developing a nuclear weapon. Iran has long denied this, saying its accelerating uranium enrichment programme is only for civilian energy purposes.In a letter distributed to the UN Security Council and seen by Reuters, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, said Barrot's comments were \"unfounded and politically irresponsible\".He said that applying the snapback would be \"legally and procedurally flawed, inadmissible, and invalid\".\"(Barrot's) open threat to reimpose sanctions with 'devastating effects' on Iran\u2019s economy constitutes a blatant act of political and economic coercion,\" the letter said.",

        "content": "Germany\u2019s Social Democrats voted in favour of the coalition deal with Friedrich Merz\u2019s conservatives, clearing the way for the Christian Democratic leader to be confirmed as chancellor next week.About 85% of SPD members who participated in the online ballot backed the blueprint for government that was agreed earlier this month with the CDU/CSU alliance, the party said on Wednesday in Berlin.\u201cThe SPD is ready to take on responsibility in the next government,\u201d Matthias Miersch, the party\u2019s general secretary, said at a news conference in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s about setting the right path to take Germany forward and above all about investing in the future of this country.\u201dOf the roughly 360,000 members, just 56% took part, with 15% voting against the accord. The SPD youth wing, which accounts for just over 10% of the membership, had led internal opposition to the agreement but failed to muster enough support to block it.To revive growth, Merz campaigned for lower taxes and tighter spending, but abandoned his hawkish fiscal stance shortly after the Feb. 23 election to pass constitutional changes that will unlock hundreds of billions of euros in debt for defense and infrastructure investment. He\u2019s also promised to clamp down on migration and rein in Germany\u2019s bureaucracy.On foreign policy, Merz aims to take a more active role in Europe in contrast to the more tepid approach of his predecessar Olaf Scholz. Once he is sworn in, he is expected to travel to Paris and Warsaw to meet counterparts Emmanuel Macron and Donald Tusk. He\u2019s also likely to soon visit Kyiv to show support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion.The 69-year-old Merz is due to be voted in by Bundestag lawmakers next Tuesday, after which he\u2019ll take his oath of office along with the members of his cabinet. The Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU, have already nominated their 10 ministers, while the SPD is expected to name its seven on Monday.Lars Klingbeil, an SPD co-leader, will take over the key finance portfolio as expected and will also be Merz\u2019s deputy as vice chancellor, according to people familiar with the planning. His twin roles were formally approved Wednesday at an SPD leadership meeting, said the people, who asked not to be identified before a public announcement.Merz, a former corporate lawyer with no experience in government, is set to take over the running of Europe\u2019s biggest economy at a time of domestic and geopolitical turmoil.His approval rating is only at around 36% and support for the parties in the next government have slumped further in polls, with combined support at about 40%, while the far-right Alternative for Germany has become the strongest force in some opinion polls. That puts pressure on Merz to act fast.\u201cHow quickly the new government draws up the budget \u2014 and whether it will be passed before the summer break \u2014 will be decisive\u201d for bolstering the economy, said Marion Muehlberger, economist and political analyst at Deutsche Bank Research.Germany\u2019s gross domestic product has shrunk the past two years and is in danger of doing so again this year. In the first quarter, the economy grew by 0.2% from the previous three months, the statistics office said on Wednesday, but more challenging times are ahead as the impact from US trade levies has yet to be fully felt.As well as restoring economic growth, coalition officials have pledged to strengthen the military and domestic security in the face of Russian aggression and tackle irregular migration, a key concern among AfD voters.While it\u2019s still unclear how the trade conflict will affect export-dependent Germany, a giant investment package the conservatives and the SPD secured last month with the support of the Greens is expected to help propel growth next year to around 1%.Merz\u2019s center-right bloc didn\u2019t hold membership ballots on the coalition deal, which was approved instead by party officials.Merz will lead a so-called \u201cGrand Coalition\u201d with the SPD, the fifth such alliance since World War II \u2014 three of them under former conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel. The last time the SPD gave members a vote on a coalition deal was in 2018 before they joined Merkel\u2019s government as junior partner.",

        "content": "The US dollar might lose more value in the future, according to Luis Oganes, the Head of Global Macro Research at JPMorgan.Oganes doesn't fully agree with the idea that the dollar's global dominance is ending. He believes this because there isn't another currency or bond market that can easily replace the size and ease of trading found in the US dollar and the US Treasury market.\u201cThis de-dollarisation, and this reduction in dollar exposure by the investors around the world will continue, but it is going to have a limit. But in that continuation that we are talking about here, in moving, let us say, from overweight to neutral, probably the dollar has more weakness to experience.\u201dRegarding the euro's value compared to the dollar, Oganes mentioned their forecast that one euro could be worth between $1.20 and $1.22 by the end of the year.He added, \u201cWe had a forecast that was already out of consensus of 1.14-1.16, and literally, we saw that being hit last week already, and we are still April. So probably, for the time being, we see weakness for the dollar.\u201dOganes believes that the uncertainty generated by the tariffs is likely to lead to a slowdown in growth, though it remains unclear if this will result in a full-blown recession.He added, \u201cAt this minute you are going to see a global growth slowdown pretty much happening everywhere, some places more than others.\u201dOganes expects inflation to remain higher in the US, primarily due to the increased cost of imports. Replacing imports, especially those from China, will take time as businesses adjust their supply chains and find alternative sources for goods. This process won't be quick, meaning inflationary pressures will persist for a while.Estimating the exact impact is challenging, but with the recent delay of tariff increases and some of the most significant hikes, Oganes predicts inflation in the US could stay around 4%, possibly 3.8%, by the end of the year.Globally, the situation will be more mixed. Slower growth in the US and other countries will bring deflationary pressures due to weaker demand. However, Oganes highlights concerns that China, unable to sell products to the US, may redirect these goods to other markets, potentially flooding the world with cheap exports. This could lead to deflation in many countries.Some nations may also respond by increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to protect their own industries. The impact on inflation will depend largely on the policy decisions made in response.One factor that could help energy-importing countries, like India, is the decline in oil prices. If local authorities allow international price drops to be reflected in domestic fuel prices, it could help offset some of the inflation caused by tariffs.",

Briefing the media, Vaishnaw said that some states have done caste surveys and conducting a census is in the domain of the central government. Vaishnaw alleged that Congress governments \"have always opposed caste census\".\n\n\"Caste was not included in all the census operations conducted since independence. In 2010, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singhji had assured the Lok Sabha that the matter of caste census should be considered in the cabinet. A group of ministers was formed to consider this subject. Most political parties recommended a caste census. Despite this, the Congress government decided to conduct only a survey of caste instead of a census. That survey is known as SECC,\" Vaishnaw said.\n\n\"It is well understood that Congress and its INDI alliance partners have only used the caste census as a political tool. As per Article 246 of the Constitution of India, the subject census is listed at 69 in the Union list in the 7th schedule. According to the Constitution of India, census is a Union subject. Some states have conducted surveys to enumerate caste. Some states have done this well, while some others have conducted such surveys purely from a political angle in a non-transparent way. Considering all these facts and to ensure that a social fabric is not disturbed by politics, caste enumeration should be transparently included in the census instead of surveys,\" he added.\n\nREAD | Who is Alok Joshi, former RAW chief, now appointed head of revamped NSA Board after Pahalgam terror attack?\n\nVaishnaw said this will strengthen the social and economic structure of the society while the nation continues to progress. \"Under the leadership of PM Modi, the Cabinet Committee of Political Affairs has decided today that Caste enumeration should be included in the forthcoming census. This demonstrates that the government is committed to the values and interests of the society and the country,\" he said.\n\nThe minister said that the Modi government had earlier introduced ten per cent reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections without causing any stress on any section of the society. Congress has been demanding a caste census, with party leaders repeatedly making the demand in their speeches.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)",

The much awaited high-speed train corridor is being built in collaboration with Japan, Fadnavis said. The USD 15 billion Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project suffered during a two-year rule until 2022, but now the work is on in full swing, added Fadnavis without naming Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray. Fadnavis also said that neighbouring state Gujarat is ahead of Maharashtra on the project development.\n\nPrior to this, Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had announced the project's deadline to be 2026, and that the operations would begin between Surat and Bilimora. Vaishnaw assured of a boost in the economy of the areas which would be covered in the journey.\n\nIn a significant milestone for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, the first 100-metre span of a 2 X 100 metre long steel bridge was successfully launched over the bustling NH-48 near Nadiad, Gujarat, the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) announced. \"This 'Make in India' steel bridge comprising two 100 m long steel spans is planned for crossing NH-48 for the Bullet Train corridor, out of which one has been successfully launched,\" as per a National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited release.

Speaking at an event on the India-Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) project organized by VRF here, he said the Vadhavan port will be operatioal in the next 3-4 years.\n\nHe said the port, being built on reclaimed land, will help reduce the cost of logistics, pointing out that the turnaround time at JNPA, India's largest container port located nearby, is higher. The Vadhavan port will also have an adjoining airport which will be built through land reclamation on the sea, Fadnavis said, adding that many major cities in the world have such airports. It will also have a halt for the bullet train, he said. The chief minister said Maharashtra is building a highway from Nashik to Vadhavan port which will ensure that 17 districts of the state get connected with the modern port.\n\nNagpur to Goa road project\n\nThe state is building the Shaktipeeth highway to connect Nagpur with Goa, Fadnavis said, adding that this road project passing through the backward regions will also help boost the economic growth. He said Mumbai and Maharashtra will play an important role in the IMEEC, and assured that the state will create the facilitating ecosystem for the project to be a success. Speaking at the same event, Sanjeev Krishan, the country chairperson of consulting firm PwC said the corridor, when combined with existing trade routes, will have a multiplier effect on the global economy.\n\n(With inputs from PTI and ANI)",

Earlier too, the Taliban condemned the terrorist attack and said that such incidents undermine efforts to ensure regional security and stability.\n\nTaliban-ruled Afghanistan shocked Islamabad when it chose to support India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack. After meeting an Indian delegation headed by MEA joint secretary Anand Prakash, who handles Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi strongly condemned the attack on April 22, in which 26 people were killed. Earlier too, the Taliban condemned the terrorist attack and said that such incidents undermine efforts to ensure regional security and stability.\n\nIndia reaches out to Taliban\n\nAs India has changed its policy on the Taliban and reached out to them on earlier occasions also, it is believed that the militant outfit will not allow Pakistan the strategic depth in Afghanistan so that anti-India elements sneak into Jammu and Kashmir and attack them or target Indian diplomats or others as in the past. Taliban has also assured Indian diplomats of providing enough security to carry out their activities fearlessly.\n\nPakistan deports Afghan refugees\n\nThe Pahalgam attack came a few days after Islamabad launched the operation of forcefully deporting more than three million Afghans living in the country as refugees. The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government has decided to send all of these Afghan refugees in three phases. Confirming this, the United Nations International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said that it had assisted more than one million people returning from Pakistan and Iran.\n\nIslamabad announced in March that it would send about 800,000 people in April. These are the people carrying Afghan Citizen Cards (ACC) issued by Pakistani authorities. Afghanistan is not happy with this decision.\n\nClashes over Durand Line\n\nPakistan-Afghanistan relations took a nosedive soon after the militants captured Kabul in August 2021. The Durand Line, which separates the two countries, became a sticky point, and the two sides got engaged in skirmishes on many occasions. Afghanistan under the Taliban rejected the line established in 1893 by British civil servant Sir Henry Mortimer Durand and Afghan Emir Abdur Rahman Khan. Earlier too, Kabul rejected it as an international border, but with the Taliban at the helm of affairs, Islamabad had hoped to make it accept its hegemony.\n\nPakistan-Afghanistan and TTP\n\nThe two sides have also quarreled openly over the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, a terrorist outfit based in Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa of Pakistan with sympathisers living on the other side of the border. The outfit aims to establish a Sharia-based rule in Pakistan; it is encouraged by the success of the Taliban in Afghanistan. They have made daring raids in Pakistan and targeted security forces, killing hundreds of its personnel. Islamabad wants the Taliban to rein in the Islamic outfit, while Afghanistan says the militants are not under its control.\n\nIndia has still not recognised the Taliban officially; however, it has reached out to the rulers in Afghanistan and assured them of continuing with the development projects started earlier. It is a big bargain for the Taliban, which needs to get support and recognition from outside to claim its legitimacy. It was a big relief for Afghanistan to receive an Indian delegation on their soil. Kabul was quick to receive the Indian diplomats with open arms and slam Pakistan for the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir.",

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nSo far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.\n\nThat means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.\n\nNot everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there \u2014 or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area \u2014 it\u2019s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.\n\nThanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California \u2014 which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers \u2014 have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.\n\nLastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won\u2019t cost you to submit a return.\n\nYour paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that\u2019s not necessarily so.\n\nOther potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:\n\nInterest on your savings\n\nInvestment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)\n\nPay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle\n\nUnemployment income\n\nSocial Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account\n\nTips\n\nGambling winnings\n\nIncome from a rental property you own\n\nOrganize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).\n\nIf you don\u2019t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts \u2014 a document may have been sent to you electronically.\n\nHere are some of the tax forms you may have received:\n\nW-2 from your wage or salaried jobs\n\nfrom your wage or salaried jobs 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments\n\nfor capital gains and losses on your investments 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments\n\nfrom your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution\n\nfor interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor\n\nfrom your clients, if you worked as a contractor 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn\u2019t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.\n\nfor payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn\u2019t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract\n\nfor distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.\n\n\u201cBe aware that there\u2019s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you\u2019re responsible for reporting it on your own,\u201d according to the Illinois CPA Society.\n\nOne very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you\u2019re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven\u2019t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.\n\nProofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you\u2019re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.\n\nLittle mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you\u2019re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.\n\nWhat to do if you can\u2019t file by April 18: If you\u2019re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.\n\nNote, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven\u2019t paid by April 18.\n\nSo if you suspect you still owe tax \u2014 perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn\u2019t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year \u2014 approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.\n\nYou can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.\n\nOr the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. \u201cThe IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,\u201d the agency notes in its instructions.\n\nIf you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select \u201cextension\u201d and then \u201ctax year 2022\u201d when given the option.\n\nYou can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don\u2019t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.\n\nIf you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state\u2019s revenue department, Martin said.\n\nUse this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an \u201cinteractive tax assistant\u201d that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.",

        "content": "Washington, DC CNN \u2014\n\nSpending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back after the banking crisis fueled recession fears.\n\nRetail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\n\nInvestors chalk up some of the weakness to a lack of tax returns and concerns about a slowing labor market. The IRS issued $84 billion in tax refunds this March, about $25 billion less than they issued in March of 2022, according to BofA analysts.\n\nThat led consumers to pull back in spending at department stores and on durable goods, such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\n\nHowever, retail spending rose 2.9% year-over-year.\n\nThe effect of smaller tax returns\n\nSmaller tax returns likely played a role in last month\u2019s decline in retail sales, along with the expiration of enhanced food assistance benefits, economists say.\n\n\u201cMarch is a really important month for refunds. Some folks might have been expecting something similar to last year,\u201d Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at BofA Global Research, told CNN.\n\nCredit and debit card spending per household tracked by Bank of America researchers moderated in March to its slowest pace in more than two years, which was likely the result of smaller returns and expired benefits, coupled with slowing wage growth.\n\nEnhanced pandemic-era benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expired in February, which might have also held back spending in March, according to a Bank of America Institute report.\n\nA slowing labor market\n\nAverage hourly earnings grew 4.2% in March from a year earlier, down from the prior month\u2019s annualized 4.6% increase and the smallest annual rise since June 2021, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Employment Cost Index, a more comprehensive measure of wages, has also shown that worker pay gains have moderated this past year. ECI data for the first quarter of this year will be released later this month.\n\nStill, the US labor market remains solid, even though it has lost momentum recently. That could hold up consumer spending in the coming months, said Michelle Meyer, North America chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute.\n\n\u201cThe big picture is still favorable for the consumer when you think about their income growth, their balance sheet and the health of the labor market,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nEmployers added 236,000 jobs in March, a robust gain by historical standards but smaller than the average monthly pace of job growth in the prior six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed that the number of available jobs remained elevated in February \u2014 but was down more than 17% from its peak of 12 million in March 2022, and revised data showed that weekly claims for US unemployment benefits were higher than previously reported.\n\nThe job market could cool further in the coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve expect the US economy to head into a recession later in the year as the lagged effects of higher interest rates take a deeper hold. Fed economists had forecast subdued growth, with risks of a recession, prior to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\nFor consumers, the effects of last month\u2019s turbulence in the banking industry have been limited so far. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan worsened slightly in March during the bank failures, but it had already shown signs of deteriorating before then.\n\nThe latest consumer sentiment reading, released Friday morning, showed that sentiment held steady in April despite the banking crisis, but that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.\n\n\u201cOn net, consumers did not perceive material changes in the economic environment in April,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a news release.\n\n\u201cConsumers are expecting a downturn, they\u2019re not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they\u2019re waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d Hsu told Bloomberg TV in an interview Friday morning.\n\nThis story has been updated with context and more details.",

Good progress was made and the presiding judge noted that there were \u201cmore than enough jurors\u201d to start the trial as scheduled on Monday.\n\nIt is there, in Courtroom 7E, where the biggest figures in Murdoch Media, accompanied by a throng of high-powered lawyers, will attempt to mount their defense after repeatedly failing to convince a judge to toss the now-historic case.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nIt\u2019s, frankly, extraordinary to write those words. When I watched Fox News broadcast election lies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, never did I expect the network to be held accountable in a meaningful way.\n\nI\u2019ve covered Fox News for a while now. I\u2019ve watched thousands and thousands of hours of the right-wing channel\u2019s programming. I\u2019ve seen its hosts over the years undermine public health, make gross anti-immigrant remarks, peddle lies and propaganda and push deranged conspiracy theories that were once reserved for the right-wing\u2019s furthest fringes.\n\nThe network has always seemed to find a way to sail through the controversy, even the most hellish storms it has faced. Sometimes it has emerged even stronger and more emboldened than before.\n\nBut this time is different. This time, the normal tricks the network turns to during times of crisis will not free it from trouble. This time, in a court of law, the network will need to put forward an honest, fact-driven argument.\n\nFox News is about to enter the true No Spin Zone, where deception is strictly prohibited. Where it is not in charge. And where its top executives like Rupert Murdoch and Suzanne Scott and hosts like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity cannot simply ignore a request for comment and resort to, instead, attacking \u201cthe media\u201d on-air.\n\nIn this setting, where lies cannot be casually told and truth cannot be distorted beyond reality to fit a dishonest narrative, it will be fascinating to see how the network fares. If the pre-trial hearings are any indicator, it won\u2019t be pretty. The case hasn\u2019t even started and the presiding judge has already lost his patience with Fox\u2019s legal team and put them on notice.\n\nPerhaps the winds will shift for Fox News when the judge gavels in the trial on Monday. But if they play out like the last few weeks of court have, Fox News is in for a brutal ride.",

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds.\n\nAs a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited.\n\nSVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color.\n\nHamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, \u201cwe\u2019re already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we\u2019re going to get hit harder.\u201d\n\nEstablished in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America\u2019s 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States.\n\nHamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.\n\nA bank run took down Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, as depositors withdrew $42 billion in a single day. Jeff Chiu/AP\n\nSVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.\n\n\u201cWhen other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,\u201d said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.\n\nMartinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.\n\nMany women and people of color say they are turned away\n\nMinority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.\n\nIn 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that\u2019s inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,\u201d Martinez told CNN.\n\nAsya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB\u2019s collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said.\n\nImmigrant founders often don\u2019t have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn\u2019t recognize them.\n\n\u201cThe community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, \u2018Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,\u2019\u201d Bradley said.\n\nMany women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the \u201ctop four banks\u201d \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.\n\nIn her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the \u201ctop four banks\u201d when her brother co-signed for her.\n\n\u201cThe top four don\u2019t want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nNone of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.\n\nLast week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country.\n\nWells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank\u2019s recent initiatives to reach underserved communities.\n\nThe bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund \u2014 a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks.\n\nBlack-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks.\n\nOneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets.\n\nSVB\u2019s collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says\n\nBecause of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company \u2014 but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented \u2014 and now we call them underestimated \u2014 founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,\u2019 because I am all three,\u201d Hamilton told CNN.\n\nSince then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase.\n\nBut Bradley, who is also an \u2018angel investor\u2019 of minority-owned businesses, said she remains \u201creally hopeful\u201d that community banks, regional banks and fintechs \u201cwill all stand up and say, \u2018Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.\u2019\u201d",

Wearing his military uniform, he sipped tea in a dark wood chair beside his grandson Dang Hoang Anh, 14, a bright-eyed soccer fan wearing a school uniform in Chelsea blue.\n\nThe boy pictured his life in different terms.\n\nHis goal? \u201cTo study in Canada.\u201d\n\nHis mission? \u201cTo make money.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandparents\u2019 generation, they had to go to war and people died,\u201d Hoang Anh said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t worry about that.

Those without legal status who remain in Pakistan, like Mr. Zada, now face repatriation. Less than three weeks after the deadline\u2019s expiration, the Pakistani minister of state for interior, Talal Chaudhry, announced at a news conference that more than 80,000 Afghans had already been expelled.\n\nThe deportations could subject the refugees to perilous conditions under the heavy hand of Taliban rule in Afghanistan.

Disinterested: In local crime. Zero Delivery: On cost of living.\u201d\n\nAt the pre-polling booths, flyers are being handed out with the headline: \u201cRepeal the Teal\u201d. They state: \u201cTeals \u2026 Not open. Not accountable. Not independent. Not worth it. Put Zoe Daniel last.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the campaign I spotted trucks with mobile billboards from another lobby group, Better Australia, driving around the electorate and parked prominently, including outside the Jewish community forum organised by members of the Jewish community at the Brighton Hebrew Congregation.\n\nFlyers distributed by Better Australia state: \u201cDon\u2019t trust the Teals this time!\u201d They also criticise Daniel for signing a letter calling for Australia to reinstate funding for UNRWA in February 2024 and claim she has ignored warnings from Jewish and other communities about rising hate and antisemitism. UNRWA is the United Nations\u2019 relief agency assisting Palestinians.\n\nBetter Australia has defended its members wearing yellow vests in Kooyong.\n\nAs my colleague Rachael Dexter has reported in Kooyong, Better Australia has also come under scrutiny for its members wearing yellow vests at the pre-polling booths which say \u201cCommunity Advisor\u201d and look very similar to the official vests worn by Australian Electoral Commission staff.\n\nA spokesman for the Liberal Party said neither it nor Tim Wilson, the party\u2019s candidate for Goldstein, have engaged Australians for Prosperity, Repeal the Teal or Better Australia.\n\nI thought it was worthwhile taking a look at exactly who these groups are, and who is behind them.\n\nYou can get in touch about any ads you see in the electorate or information on the lobby groups behind them using the form below.\n\nWho are Australians for Prosperity?\n\nAustralians for Prosperity is a lobby group headed by former Liberal MP Jason Falinski, a friend of Wilson, the Liberal candidate for Goldstein.\n\nA Liberal Party spokesman described Falinski and Wilson\u2019s relationship as that of \u201cformer parliamentary colleagues\u201d. However, Falinksi told The Age they are \u201cgood friends\u201d.\n\nThe pair came under scrutiny when, as MPs in 2019, they used a taxpayer-funded inquiry into Labor\u2019s franking credits policy to raise funds for the Liberals.\n\nFormer federal MP Jason Falinski now heads Australians for Prosperity. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nLetters to self-managed super fund trustees from Falinski, who was then part of parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Economics, using the inquiry to entice voters to donate to the Liberal Party in exchange for an audience with Wilson, who was then the committee chair.\n\nFalinski and Wilson also wrote a joint column for the Australian Financial Review from 2022 to 2024. Both lost their seats at the 2022 election.\n\nFalinski says he has contacted Wilson \u201cfrom time to time\u201d over the course of the election campaign just to check in on how he is going, but \u201cwe don\u2019t talk tactics\u201d. He says he is not co-ordinating the Australians for Prosperity campaign with Wilson, nor with the Liberal Party.\n\nBefore Falinski took over running Australians for Prosperity, Julian Simmons, the former Liberal MP for the Brisbane seat of Ryan, was the executive director of the group.\n\nSimmonds was this month appointed acting chief executive of Economic Development Queensland by Queensland\u2019s new Liberal National state government. He began in that position on April 22 and references to him have been removed from the Australians for Prosperity website.\n\nAustralians for Prosperity has received significant funding from the coal industry, and electoral records show it received $725,000 in donations from Coal Australia.\n\nFalinski says Australians for Prosperity is not a lobby group for the coal industry and the majority of its funding comes from \u201cordinary Australians\u201d, including some high net-worth individuals who made their money in manufacturing and farming, and a property heiress.\n\nHe says the teals\u2019 links to Climate 200 should also be subject to scrutiny.\n\nWho are Repeal the Teal?\n\nRepeal the Teal is a lobby group founded by the Jewish activist network, J-United, which is affiliated with the right-wing lobby group Advance Australia. The campaign has been active in other teal-held electorates, including Kooyong.\n\nThe campaign is also busy on social media, as Advance Australia has spent $255,676 in the past 90 days in Victoria on advertising with Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook.\n\nRepeal the Teal\u2019s materials are authorised by Harriet Warlow-Shill, a Melbourne lawyer who hosted an online event in March called \u201cDoes my teal support terror? One woman\u2019s journey to find out\u201d.\n\nWarlow-Shill says the Repeal the Teal campaign is not linked to the Liberal Party and she is no longer a Liberal Party member.\n\n\u201cI resigned from the party on 27 February, 2025 to ensure this is a stand-alone effort by myself and a few other ladies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have no prior experience running campaigns.\u201d\n\nA Repeal the Teal flyer.\n\nWho are Better Australia?\n\nBetter Australia is incorporated in NSW and was formerly known as \u201cBetter NSW Incorporated\u201d before changing its name in January.\n\nIt is a spin-off of Better Council, which targeted the Greens during last year\u2019s local council elections in NSW, and has now turned its focus to teal-held seats including Goldstein.\n\nA company search shows Sophie Calland is Better Australia\u2019s public officer, and in an email, she says the group is an \u201cindependent non-partisan community initiative\u201d.\n\nA truck with Better Australia advertising.\n\n\u201cWe believe a minority government comprising of Greens and teal \u2018independents\u2019 will be incredibly destructive for everyday Australians,\u201d Callan says in the email.\n\n\u201cFormer minority governments have led to stalling legislation and dramatic swings in government policy that do not align with what the public has voted for. It means whoever is in power must negotiate with extreme or elite voices that do not represent the public.\u201d\n\nCalland says Better Australia isn\u2019t affiliated with any political party, although she is a member of the Labor Party.\n\n\u201cWe are registered as a significant third-party entity for the upcoming 2025 federal election,\u201d she says.\n\nCalland says she has had no contact with Wilson during the campaign.\n\n\u201cBut Better Australia\u2019s local volunteers in Goldstein are doing everything they can to ensure that voters don\u2019t get tricked by the teals in the election,\u201d she says.\n\nBetter Australia also has an extensive online presence, having spent $66,010 in Victoria in the past 90 days on advertising with Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.",

It was only when his death was announced that I discovered that he was a knife sharpener (C8) and local identity.\u201d\n\nJohn Boddington of Dalton remembers a similar local identity: \u201cHis name was Harold Wright (\u2018The Sharpening King\u2019) and his extraordinary sharpening wagon is now in the National Museum. I have a strong suspicion that Heath Robinson had a hand in the design. I can recall seeing Harold\u2019s wagon as a small boy a long time ago and longing to have a bash at turning all the stuff on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I try to keep my Ukrainian stories light-hearted, Doug McLaughlin\u2019s memories of subs bombing Sydney in WWII (C8) have certainly triggered some recent trauma,\u201d admits Chris Keane. \u201cA few days ago I was at home in Seattle when my phone started blowing up with messages from \u2018my\u2019 kids in Ukraine.

And Senator Ralph Babet is stranded in his Victorian Senate seat.\n\nIf, as many, including Sydney Criminal Lawyers, suggest, Palmer needs a dog in the election race, 'because he wants to safeguard the billions of dollars in profit that come from the mining, iron, nickel and local holdings', he needed to act fast.\n\nThere was no way Palmer was going to be able to round up 1,500 bona fide members to get a party registered with the Australian Electoral Comission (AEC) in time for the 2025 Election (or perhaps anytime), but he had a mate, Nick Duffield, a Trumpist management consultant who had started the whole Trumpet of Patriots thing.\n\nDuffield had whipped up a bit of initial enthusiasm. Not enough to form a political party but enough to convince the right-wing Christians and, importantly, AEC-registered The Australian Federation Party that a merger might not be a bad idea.\n\nOn 3 December 2024, the AEC recognised a name change from Australian Federation Party to Trumpet of Patriots.\n\nExactly when and how Malice and Duffield did this whole deal is opaque, but they pulled it off, the lurid yellow advertising with its preposterous claims being the evidence.\n\nAccording to its website:\n\n\u2018The Trumpet of Patriots will preference Labor and the Liberals last in the 2025 Federal Election to end the two-party duopoly and make Australia great.\u2019\n\nThis is where the average Trumpet of Patriots voter might become confused \u2014 who to preference?\u2019\n\nThere is a plethora of choice for those who like to pick their poison.\n\nFrom the simple racism and xenophobia of One Nation to the \u201cUp yours!\u201d of Craig Kelly and the Libertarians, from the anti-woke of HEART to the Drag Queen Storytime of Family First, T.O.P. voters will be swooning with choice.\n\nThe thing is, it just doesn\u2019t matter because there will be bugger-all T.O.P. voters. Friends and relatives of the many T.O.P. candidates plus a few sundry suckers if they\u2019re lucky. T.O.P.\u2019s preferences will be minuscule and won\u2019t trouble the scorer.\n\nNone of its candidates has a chance.\n\nMany of the current crop of candidates hope they can do a Ralph Babet, some probably fantasise about it at night. Surf Clive\u2019s money to Canberra. Like winning Deal or No Deal.\n\nPalmer\u2019s old UAP got 4.1 per cent overall last time around in 2021 at a cost of $125 million, but Trumpet is not UAP.\n\nFor starters, there is the name. Over the last few months, its spiritual beacon has gone from hero to sub-zero, from saviour to threat. It can\u2019t be escaped, it is right there at the start of the name.\n\nThen there is the logo. The thing holding the trumpet has got blowhard baked right in, referential to its owner, maybe. A malignant Teletubbie was the model, frightening in a too-much-medication kind of way.\n\nBut most of all, there is ennui.\n\nAustralians have seen this all before. P.U.P., UAP, T.O.P. \u2014 always the same. Massive ad spends, lurid graphics, a squillion unknown candidates, fantastical claims.\n\nThe playbook worked well the first time around.\n\nIn the first Palmer United Party (P.U.P.) iteration, back in the 2013 Election, Malice himself became Member for Fairfax, famous for sleeping in the Chamber. The party also catapulted Dio Wang, Glenn Lazarus and Jacqui Lambie to the Senate.\n\nDio and Glen fell by the wayside, but Jacqui went on to a successful political future after she parted company with Clive.\n\nPalmer deregistered P.U.P. in 2016 but then, in 2018, registered the United Australia Party.\n\nSecond time round, in 2018 as the United Australia Party, Palmer fell a bit short of P.U.P.\u2019s 2013 performance.\n\nThe party failed to win any electoral contest. Lots of money, no cigars.\n\nThird time, in 2021, again as UAP \u2014 \u201cMeh\u201d.\n\nAgain, a lot of money, ads everywhere, but this time some success with one Victorian Senator, Ralph Babet, a real estate agent from the wide development lands just out of Melbourne\u2019s east, around Berwick. Ralph is a right-wing warrior who, thankfully, has had little influence on the body politic to date.\n\nWould you buy a property from this man?\n\nNow, in 2025, Palmer\u2019s fourth go with Trumpet of Patriots, same tired formula.\n\nRemember UAP\u2019s 2021 advertising when Craig Kelly was going to be Australia\u2019s next prime minister?\n\nDidn\u2019t happen, Craig ended up defecting to the Libertarians, a move that will surely strangle any hopes for that party.\n\nSpare a thought for Trumpet\u2019s alleged leader and next prime minister, former Cessnock Councillor Suellen Wrightson.\n\nShe is running in Hunter, a seat held by Labour since basically forever.\n\nSuellen is listed in the \u2018Other\u2019 column on the ballot paper alongside other fringe parties of various stripes.\n\nHappily for her, there will probably be a vacancy coming up with the Libertarians after this election.\n\nRoss Jones is IA's investigations editor and the author of 'Ashbygate: The Plot to Destroy Australia's Speaker'.\n\nRelated Articles",

        "content": "It would take a miracle of messianic proportions for Peter Dutton to defy the odds and secure victory in the forthcoming Federal Election, says founder Dave Donovan.\n\nDESPITE being an alumnus of St Paul's Anglican School, located in the ominously prophetic suburb of Bald Hills in northern Brisbane, Peter Dutton is reportedly not particularly religious.\n\nIn any case, as he takes a break from a bruising fortnight of campaigning this long weekend, relaxing over a non-sacramental wine or two in one of his many houses, perhaps Dutton may pause to consider what this time of year, Easter, really represents \u2014 utterly implausible miracles. That even if you have been mocked, derided, crucified and killed stone dead, don't give up. If you keep on trying, you just never know. Be like Jesus and don't leave any stone unturned, especially one sealing you in a crypt.\n\nMaybe he might consider those things. But probably not. Because, to be fair, even the son of god might baulk at a job as big as resurrecting Peter Dutton's faltering electoral hopes. IA does not want to speak ill of the dead, naturally, but based on the first two weeks of the current electoral campaign, Peter Dutton is floundering worse than a half-eaten Friday prawn in an uncollected wheelie bin next Wednesday.\n\nTo briefly sum up the debacle, for a start, many people have taken to deriding Peter Dutton as Australia's \u201cTemu Trump\u201d. That is, a cheap, second-rate version of the real thing. But now with the original strongman becoming deeply disdained almost everywhere, Dutton\u2019s halting impression of Trump is fast becoming even more distasteful.\n\nSomehow, incredibly, the Opposition Leader\u2019s pratfalls, gaffes, hijinks and flagrant fibs are seen as even less charming than those of the Teflon Felon. Aussies, it seems, have made up their minds about Dutton. After watching the chaos wrought by Trump in America, they seem to have decided that you have to be very careful what you \"Wish\" for.\n\nIf Dutton had any sense at all \u2013 a proposition that even the most careful election watchers have so far found only faint evidence to support \u2013 he would stop sipping that unholy wine and get royally pissed.\n\nBut then again, you never know. Anything is possible for the Liberal Party faithful. And particularly in Australia, miracles can and do occur at Federal election time.\n\nNo, Peter Dutton is not the messiah. But he does have someone on his side who is almost as influential in this Down Underworld. The unholy \u201cSun God\u201d himself, Rupert Murdoch, flanked by his many malignant minions. Against all the odds, for example, \u201cRupee\u201d manifested the ascension of the \"Mad Monk\", Tony Abbott, and engineered the reanimation of \u201cLazarus with a Triple Bypass\u201d, John Howard. Both utterly unelectable in the minds of almost all sane individuals, but nonetheless risen up via the fiendish interventions of the Sun\u2019s many Heralds and his ever-trumpeting host.\n\nThe lesson here today is that nothing is certain under the Sun. Nothing is assured. Need we even mention \u201cPentecostal\u201d Scott Morrison\u2019s election \u201cmiracle\u201d of 2019? Dearly beloved, this publication is, despite rather shamelessly referencing religious tropes throughout this seasonal editorial, staunchly and avowedly agnostic and secular. Nevertheless, we would like to casually mention that Morrison\u2019s subsequent administration (amongst many other calamities) featured a literal plague of biblical proportions.\n\nTo state it baldly, IA considers that Peter Dutton would make a dreadful leader for Australia. Australia appears to agree.\n\nSeldom has the danger he poses to our nation been better communicated than by an excommunicated Murdoch scribe by the name of Tony Koch on X/Twitter.\n\n\u2018Dutton's failure is because he is a nasty, negative, standover bully who is not very bright. He relies on his size, his ugliness, to make people cower.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, Tony\u2019s concludes that post by suggesting Dutton's many unsavoury attributes may preclude him from becoming Australia's next prime minister:\n\n\u2018Won't work old mate. The dogs are barking the numbers in your party for a replacement.\u2019\n\nTony Koch is a good man and an idealist. But perhaps a trifle naive, because Tony Abbott was a literal pugilist who punched a hole in the wall beside a female political rival\u2019s head, amongst other vile acts, as IA faithfully reported here.\n\nSadly, no behaviour is too untoward to disqualify someone for high political office. Not in America, as we have seen with the felon Trump, and especially not in Australia, where the Murdoch media and its fellow dissemblers hold a manifestly market-distorting near monopoly over metropolitan media circulation, and therefrom public opinion.\n\nIt is understandable to write off such obviously inadequate candidates for public office. It seems wildly counterintuitive that such people could garner public support \u2014 Donald Trump being an obvious example. He was written off against Clinton and again against Harris. But he won, despite the prevailing tide of opinion polls suggesting he was behind leading up to both elections.\n\nIn Australia, polls taken this week point to a range of outcomes, from solid trouncing to devastating defeat for Dutton\u2019s pretenders on 3 May.\n\nFederal Two Party Preferred (2PP) polling this week (%):\n\nNews Poll (News Corp): 13 April: ALP 52 \u2013 L-NP 48\n\nRoy Morgan 14 April: ALP 54.5 \u2013 L-NP 45.5\n\nResolve (Nine) 15 April: ALP 53.5 \u2013 L-NP 46.5\n\nEssential (Guardian) 16 April: ALP 55 \u2013 L-NP 45\n\nAll this points towards a convincing win. But the polls also pointed to a similarly convincing win for Bill Shorten in the lead-up to the 2019 Election. So convincing, indeed, bookmakers Sportsbet paid out on a Labor victory on the day of the election, even before the polls had closed. Bill Shorten seemed assuredly on his way to victory for Labor in 2019, but he wasn\u2019t.\n\nThis publication trusts the polls even less than we do bookies, which isn't much. But many people still adhere to the old adage, \u201cfollow the money\u201d, putting their faith in the tote.\n\nThe current betting odds, according to bookies (Sportsbet, TAB, Ladbrokes), show Labor well ahead.\n\nBut the ALP may not win.\n\nEven though no first-term government from either side of politics has been thrown out of office after only serving a single term since 1931, the result is still uncertain.\n\nOpinion polls and expert opinions notwithstanding, Independent Australia\u2019s laboriously made message this Easter is not to count your eggs before they\u2019re laid.\n\nAnd one more thing. Elections are not just between two political parties. They are not a horse race or a war. In fact, our system of representative democracy is about individuals standing for election to represent their constituents.\n\nPeter Dutton, for example, might lead his party to victory on Saturday, May 3, but still lose his own seat. His seat of Dickson, north of Brisbane, is one of the most marginal seats in the country, and Temu Trump holds it by a mere 1.7%. Recent polls suggest he is behind in Dickson, which also has very credible candidates in Labor's Ali France, The Greens' Vinnie Batten and Independent Ellie Smith.\n\nThe bookies say Dutton will win anyway. But who knows? At Easter, even the impossible may be possible.\n\nBut this time, probably not. Because few, it seems, are keen to see a second coming of Peter Dutton.\n\nPeter Dutton dismisses 52-48 2PP to Labor polling in his seat of Dickson & insists he's up 5 points. His latest conspiracy theory is GetUp have become Teals who are really Greens & Labor members. He mentions teal coloured shirts but the IND colour is maroon in Dickson. #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/992DJiDBRQ \u2014 David Marler (@Qldaah) April 12, 2025\n\nThis is not the whole story!

        "content": "Days away from the Federal Election, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has yet to offer the voting public any reason to elect him, writes Dr Alex Vickery-Howe.\n\nSOME TIME AGO, when Peter Dutton was first made Leader of the Opposition in Australia, I expressed strong doubts. In 2022, the prospects of a Coalition leader swinging even further to the right, when the Teal Independents had demonstrated that centre-right voters believe in and care deeply about catastrophic climate change, seemed slim at best.\n\nMy doubts were focused on Dutton\u2019s refusal to build policy based on science and common sense, and his dogged quest to drag his party away from an electable centre and further to the right. I also called him \u2018spooky\u2019 and I won\u2019t apologise for that.\n\nI believe most human beings deserve the presumption of goodwill, but Dutton lost that for me way back in 2015 when he made a sickening quip about Pacific Island nations facing the brunt of climate disaster. That callous one-liner told all Australians that Dutton does believe in climate science; he just doesn\u2019t empathise with those affected.\n\nFriends would say I have a sick sense of humour. An acerbic sense of humour. But there\u2019s a time and a place. Dutton didn\u2019t choose either well. He claimed he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and I agree that he did. I would say his mistake was mocking those who stand to lose everything because self-proclaimed \u201cclimate sceptics\u201d, which Dutton only pretends to be, refuse to comprehend the meaning of scientific consensus (a hint: it\u2019s not a bunch of people in lab coats conspiring with NASA).\n\nDutton, on the other hand, would probably say his mistake was making his unwise comment in front of a boom mic that even then-PM Scott Morrison was sharp enough to notice.\n\nDutton\u2019s \u201cjoke\u201d should\u2019ve disqualified him from leading the Coalition. His recent national security lie should disqualify him from the top job. Fabricating nonsense stories about foreign leaders does not a worthy prime minister make. I remain less confident now, however, than I did when I wrote that earlier article.\n\nIn 2025, the global mood has swung. Americans call this the \u201cvibe shift\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s no state secret that the fortunes of President Donald Trump are connected to Dutton\u2019s chances at the polls. Trump has proven to be a renewed force, nurturing class resentment to once again occupy the White House. In response, Dutton has leapt upon buzzwords like \u201cwoke\u201d to set his agenda. Clive Palmer is doing the same thing, of course, but Palmer can barely read an autocue.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, mimicking Trump may have seemed like a sound campaign strategy. Much to Dutton\u2019s consternation, Trump has burned through his political capital in record time.\n\nThe Trump tariffs are wildly unpopular and self-evidently idiotic. Car factories and manufacturing plants are not likely to reappear, as if by sorcery, given that any self-respecting CEO is going to shy away from setting up in the U.S. under such an unpredictable and volatile administration. Trump proved the precariousness of investing in America\u2019s future when he backflipped on his own policy.\n\nEven if the magic emanates from those tiny hands and domestic manufacturing does return, do we really believe that production lines in 2025 are going to be humancentric? Have we learned nothing from Amazon?\n\nTrump\u2019s political capital was further incinerated when he kidnapped an innocent man and shipped him to El Salvador. Not even the bootlickers with fork tongues could support that level of cruelty. Not even Joe Rogan.\n\nI hope we still live in a world where that kind of brutalism and injustice is met with universal outrage, contempt and a desire to fight back and reclaim America\u2019s sanity, if not her soul. I hope I see the day when Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda sues the American Government for its arrogance, its spite and its failure.\n\nFor Dutton, the sudden rise and fall of Trump in the global consciousness has necessitated a dance. First, he was all in on Team Trump. More recently, he has changed his tune. Will Dutton make sweeping cuts to the public service as Trump did? Or has that policy been scrapped? Will he force people back to work offline? Or was that another Dutton \u201cmistake\u201d? It\u2019s hard to tell what you stand for when you\u2019re too busy tapping your toes.\n\nDutton has, in fact, mimicked Trump accidentally by cosying up one minute and then retreating the next, with a shrug and an \u201cI\u2019ve never met the man\u201d pivot that Trump himself has perfected from countless disastrous associations over the years.\n\nIt was with Trumpian baggage attached that Dutton approached the ABC debate against Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on 16 April. Poor Dutton spent the duration sweating, twisting and obfuscating. He didn\u2019t have a clear platform. He didn\u2019t have a message for the Australian people. He\u2019s not even spooky anymore; he\u2019s a little tragic.\n\nOn climate change, he deferred to science, but stopped short of acknowledging extreme weather events in his native Queensland. That won\u2019t please the so-called \u201csceptics\u201d and it won\u2019t inspire anyone who can see what\u2019s plainly happening. It was a non-position.\n\nOn the U.S. tariffs, he puffed and blustered about his ability to deliver exemptions, then conceded that he didn\u2019t know Trump. How exactly is he going to negotiate more successfully than any other world leader when he has no idea what he\u2019s walking into? So much hot air. So much flaccid machismo. Much like Trump with Putin.\n\nOn his lies about Indonesia, he apologised meekly, after refusing to do so in the lead up to the debate.\n\nDoing so gave Albanese a free kick:\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try to use international relations to support domestic politics.\u201d\n\nTouch\u00e9, Albo.\n\nBut where Dutton was at his most desperate \u2013 and this may be the lie that defines the Election \u2013 was when he linked the housing crisis with international students. This is one of the dumbest things a public figure in Australia has ever said. He started this prior to the debate and doubled down on the night. It\u2019s nonsense and it needs to be called out.\n\nConservatives in opposition claim to be allies of the working people. All that \u201cI\u2019ll fight for you\u201d rhetoric vanishes when they seize power. We\u2019ve seen that in the chaos and incompetence of the contemporary United States. There is no reason to trust Dutton on this issue. The Coalition has never cared about struggling families. That\u2019s the first reality \u201ccheque\u201d (don't try to bank on it).\n\nThe second reality check is that while foreign ownership should be addressed, the housing crisis in Australia has nothing whatsoever to do with international students or with immigration in general. It\u2019s an easy lie that may well be attractive to people who enjoy lazy solutions, but it doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. Dutton is borrowing from the old John Howard playbook of demonising minorities to score cheap points.\n\nA more credible argument, mounted by the Prime Minister, is that we have a housing supply issue. This is a footnote to the story.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the actual story...\n\nNegative gearing: the sword that Bill Shorten died on. It\u2019s clear that neither major party is brave enough to pick up that sword again, but a system that fundamentally rewards investors and deprives younger Australians of the chance to enter the market is a system built on generational inequality.\n\nThat system won\u2019t play well this election, as emerging generations now outnumber Boomer voters. The Australian Greens are touching this policy and that may make life interesting for Albanese if Labor is forced to enter into a partnership to form a minority government.\n\nMy hunch is that Dutton\u2019s broad attacks against immigrants won\u2019t land with the Australian electorate. It\u2019s a stale and mean-spirited argument; a Coalition clich\u00e9 that younger people are statistically less likely to adopt.\n\nGenerational warfare, on the other hand, will play very well for the Greens. Unlike the United States, where economic hardship and class divisions can be diverted into MAGA racism, Australia is a nation where the fault lines between Boomers, Gen X, Millennials and Gen Z carry much stronger cultural weight. Deep down, young people know their elders are hogging the Australian dream.\n\nMy money says the housing crisis will drive votes. Regardless, this election does represent a real choice.\n\nOn the Labor ticket: Medicare. Paid parental leave. Robust education \u2013 something Australia desperately needs \u2013 the science of climate change and renewable energy.\n\nOn the Coalition ticket: Scientific illiteracy. Denial of reality. Whinging. Blame. A nuclear power station Australia cannot afford. Diet Trump posturing with no substance behind it.\n\nI\u2019m not sure the debate told us anything new. The likelihood of Australia waking up to a new PM will largely come down to the impact of the \u201cvibe shift\u201d and whether Trump has soured the ascendency of the far-right as badly, and as quickly, as pollsters indicate. My hopes are tempered by an awareness that we all live in bubbles and we all have dangerous blind spots.\n\nFor Australia, my hope is that we see through the populism, the scapegoating and the relentless negativity of the Coalition and move back to big, brave policy that actually helps people on the ground. It\u2019s time to stop bickering at the edges and actually tackle the major issues facing Australians.\n\nAt a time when people in power are listening to Iron Man wannabe billionaires, attempting to drive people apart and creating wedges instead of putting people first, can someone please explain why every world leader is seemingly obsessed with golf?\n\nDr Alex Vickery-Howe is an award-winning playwright and social commentator.

        "content": "Australian states could have green, urban and citizen-centred cities just like Amsterdam in future, writes Paul Budde.\n\nOPEN INNOVATION PLATFORM Amsterdam InChange is a leading not-for-profit that brings together governments, businesses, researchers and citizens to co-create future-ready cities.\n\nIn August last year, I reported on my discussion with Frans Anton Vermast. A frequent representative at international smart city conferences, he is currently in Australia under the banner Amsterdam InChange. The name evolved from Amsterdam Smart City, as it was previously known.\n\nThis change reflects a broader shift \u2014 smart city thinking is no longer a niche; it is becoming central to mainstream urban development.\n\nOur discussion focused on the city\u2019s transition toward a \u201csmart, sustainable, and citizen-first\u201d model \u2014 an approach that integrates innovation, environmental responsibility and people-centred governance.\n\nThis collaborative and inclusive model offers valuable lessons for Australian state investment agencies such as Trade and Investment Queensland (TIQ), Investment NSW, WA Investments, Invest NT, and Invest Victoria, as well as local and regional governments seeking to create more liveable, resilient and sustainable communities.\n\nSustainability: Circular thinking for a healthier planet\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s ambition to become a fully circular economy by 2050, inspired by Doughnut Economics, offers a practical pathway for Australian cities facing climate and waste challenges.\n\nOpportunities exist for collaboration on sustainable construction, waste minimisation and green job creation \u2014 particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, where these principles could help launch new industries and protect local ecosystems.\n\nMobility: Reducing emissions, increasing access\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s push for electric mobility and world-class cycling infrastructure shows how cities can thrive without relying on cars.\n\nThis is a promising model for WA Investments and Invest NT to consider for cities like Perth and Darwin. E-bike sharing schemes, integrated mobility apps and electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure could transform these urban areas into healthier, less congested and more accessible places.\n\nUrban development: Putting people at the heart\n\nThrough its Green Infrastructure Vision 2050, Amsterdam leads in designing climate-proof, liveable neighbourhoods \u2014 green corridors, biodiversity hubs and mixed-use zones that support wellbeing and social connection.\n\nInvest Victoria, for instance, could apply these principles to Melbourne\u2019s evolving suburbs, turning underused land into vibrant, human-centred precincts.\n\nDigital services: empowering through technology\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s citizen-focused digital strategy \u2013 emphasising trust, privacy and inclusion \u2013 demonstrates how digital tools can enable, rather than overwhelm. From secure digital identities to participatory online platforms, Amsterdam gives citizens a real voice in decision-making.\n\nSimilar initiatives could be championed by Investment NSW and TIQ to foster civic trust and improve service delivery, especially in regional or marginalised communities.\n\nKey lessons for investment\n\nSome key lessons from Amsterdam InChange for Australian investment agencies include:\n\nfostering open innovation ecosystems by supporting regional \u201cliving labs\u201d that bring councils, universities, startups and citizens together;\n\nembedding circular economy principles in pilot projects across housing, construction and waste management;\n\ninvesting in low-emission, people-first mobility models suited to Australia\u2019s unique geographies;\n\ndesigning urban spaces with climate resilience and community in mind, beyond real estate returns;\n\nbuilding digital services that prioritise privacy, trust and access, especially for those in remote areas; and\n\nletting citizens lead through co-creation, experience panels and participatory budgeting.\n\nWhy this matters: Tangible benefits for citizens\n\nThis is not just about visionary policy.\n\nThe real-world outcomes of such collaboration include:\n\ncleaner air and reduced emissions from sustainable transport;\n\ngreener, more connected cities with stronger communities;\n\neasier, safer access to services through digital inclusion;\n\ngrowth in green jobs and innovation sectors; and\n\nhealthier lifestyles supported by walkable, well-designed neighbourhoods.\n\nBy embracing the best and next practices and lessons of Amsterdam InChange, Australia\u2019s state investment agencies can become drivers of globally relevant, locally tailored change. The result? Cities that aren\u2019t just smart \u2014 they\u2019re also fair, green and deeply human.\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s model shows us that true innovation happens when everyone is invited to shape it, and when progress is measured not just in GDP, but in well-being.\n\nFrans Anton will be back in August this year when he will continue to present this vision to several organisations in Australia.\n\nPaul Budde is an IA columnist and managing director of independent telecommunications research consultancy, Paul Budde Consulting.

        "content": "Spend any time in the electorate of Goldstein and it\u2019s hard to avoid the attack ads targeting teal independent MP Zoe Daniel.\n\nThere\u2019s the giant billboard opposite the Kingston City Hall authorised by Australians for Prosperity, featuring a photo of Daniel\u2019s head in a balloon.\n\n\u201cAll hot air: Vote for change,\u201d the ad states. \u201cBlocked: Local voices. Disinterested: In local crime. Zero Delivery: On cost of living.\u201d\n\nAt the pre-polling booths, flyers are being handed out with the headline: \u201cRepeal the Teal\u201d. They state: \u201cTeals \u2026 Not open. Not accountable. Not independent. Not worth it. Put Zoe Daniel last.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the campaign I spotted trucks with mobile billboards from another lobby group, Better Australia, driving around the electorate and parked prominently, including outside the Jewish community forum organised by members of the Jewish community at the Brighton Hebrew Congregation.\n\nFlyers distributed by Better Australia state: \u201cDon\u2019t trust the Teals this time!\u201d They also criticise Daniel for signing a letter calling for Australia to reinstate funding for UNRWA in February 2024 and claim she has ignored warnings from Jewish and other communities about rising hate and antisemitism. UNRWA is the United Nations\u2019 relief agency assisting Palestinians.\n\nBetter Australia has defended its members wearing yellow vests in Kooyong.\n\nAs my colleague Rachael Dexter has reported in Kooyong, Better Australia has also come under scrutiny for its members wearing yellow vests at the pre-polling booths which say \u201cCommunity Advisor\u201d and look very similar to the official vests worn by Australian Electoral Commission staff.\n\nA spokesman for the Liberal Party said neither it nor Tim Wilson, the party\u2019s candidate for Goldstein, have engaged Australians for Prosperity, Repeal the Teal or Better Australia.\n\nI thought it was worthwhile taking a look at exactly who these groups are, and who is behind them.\n\nYou can get in touch about any ads you see in the electorate or information on the lobby groups behind them using the form below.\n\nWho are Australians for Prosperity?\n\nAustralians for Prosperity is a lobby group headed by former Liberal MP Jason Falinski, a friend of Wilson, the Liberal candidate for Goldstein.\n\nA Liberal Party spokesman described Falinski and Wilson\u2019s relationship as that of \u201cformer parliamentary colleagues\u201d. However, Falinksi told The Age they are \u201cgood friends\u201d.\n\nThe pair came under scrutiny when, as MPs in 2019, they used a taxpayer-funded inquiry into Labor\u2019s franking credits policy to raise funds for the Liberals.\n\nFormer federal MP Jason Falinski now heads Australians for Prosperity. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer\n\nLetters to self-managed super fund trustees from Falinski, who was then part of parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Economics, using the inquiry to entice voters to donate to the Liberal Party in exchange for an audience with Wilson, who was then the committee chair.\n\nFalinski and Wilson also wrote a joint column for the Australian Financial Review from 2022 to 2024. Both lost their seats at the 2022 election.\n\nFalinski says he has contacted Wilson \u201cfrom time to time\u201d over the course of the election campaign just to check in on how he is going, but \u201cwe don\u2019t talk tactics\u201d. He says he is not co-ordinating the Australians for Prosperity campaign with Wilson, nor with the Liberal Party.\n\nBefore Falinski took over running Australians for Prosperity, Julian Simmons, the former Liberal MP for the Brisbane seat of Ryan, was the executive director of the group.\n\nSimmonds was this month appointed acting chief executive of Economic Development Queensland by Queensland\u2019s new Liberal National state government. He began in that position on April 22 and references to him have been removed from the Australians for Prosperity website.\n\nAustralians for Prosperity has received significant funding from the coal industry, and electoral records show it received $725,000 in donations from Coal Australia.\n\nFalinski says Australians for Prosperity is not a lobby group for the coal industry and the majority of its funding comes from \u201cordinary Australians\u201d, including some high net-worth individuals who made their money in manufacturing and farming, and a property heiress.\n\nHe says the teals\u2019 links to Climate 200 should also be subject to scrutiny.\n\nWho are Repeal the Teal?\n\nRepeal the Teal is a lobby group founded by the Jewish activist network, J-United, which is affiliated with the right-wing lobby group Advance Australia. The campaign has been active in other teal-held electorates, including Kooyong.\n\nThe campaign is also busy on social media, as Advance Australia has spent $255,676 in the past 90 days in Victoria on advertising with Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook.\n\nRepeal the Teal\u2019s materials are authorised by Harriet Warlow-Shill, a Melbourne lawyer who hosted an online event in March called \u201cDoes my teal support terror? One woman\u2019s journey to find out\u201d.\n\nWarlow-Shill says the Repeal the Teal campaign is not linked to the Liberal Party and she is no longer a Liberal Party member.\n\n\u201cI resigned from the party on 27 February, 2025 to ensure this is a stand-alone effort by myself and a few other ladies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have no prior experience running campaigns.\u201d\n\nA Repeal the Teal flyer.\n\nWho are Better Australia?\n\nBetter Australia is incorporated in NSW and was formerly known as \u201cBetter NSW Incorporated\u201d before changing its name in January.\n\nIt is a spin-off of Better Council, which targeted the Greens during last year\u2019s local council elections in NSW, and has now turned its focus to teal-held seats including Goldstein.\n\nA company search shows Sophie Calland is Better Australia\u2019s public officer, and in an email, she says the group is an \u201cindependent non-partisan community initiative\u201d.\n\nA truck with Better Australia advertising.\n\n\u201cWe believe a minority government comprising of Greens and teal \u2018independents\u2019 will be incredibly destructive for everyday Australians,\u201d Callan says in the email.\n\n\u201cFormer minority governments have led to stalling legislation and dramatic swings in government policy that do not align with what the public has voted for. It means whoever is in power must negotiate with extreme or elite voices that do not represent the public.\u201d\n\nCalland says Better Australia isn\u2019t affiliated with any political party, although she is a member of the Labor Party.\n\n\u201cWe are registered as a significant third-party entity for the upcoming 2025 federal election,\u201d she says.\n\nCalland says she has had no contact with Wilson during the campaign.\n\n\u201cBut Better Australia\u2019s local volunteers in Goldstein are doing everything they can to ensure that voters don\u2019t get tricked by the teals in the election,\u201d she says.\n\nBetter Australia also has an extensive online presence, having spent $66,010 in Victoria in the past 90 days on advertising with Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.",

        "content": "\u201cSo sad. No more Vera,\u201d laments Robert Hosking of Paddington. \u201cBut it was the penultimate episode that caught my attention, when her longtime associate gets a nasty bashing by the baddy. All I could think was: \u2018Oh my God, they killed Kenny!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I moved to Sydney in the \u201970s, I used to see a bearded man wheeling a mysterious wooden box on wheels around the Hyde Park area,\u201d writes Donald Hawes of Peel. \u201cThere was even a wooden ramp built over the park steps near Museum Station, just wide enough for his vehicle. It was only when his death was announced that I discovered that he was a knife sharpener (C8) and local identity.\u201d\n\nJohn Boddington of Dalton remembers a similar local identity: \u201cHis name was Harold Wright (\u2018The Sharpening King\u2019) and his extraordinary sharpening wagon is now in the National Museum. I have a strong suspicion that Heath Robinson had a hand in the design. I can recall seeing Harold\u2019s wagon as a small boy a long time ago and longing to have a bash at turning all the stuff on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I try to keep my Ukrainian stories light-hearted, Doug McLaughlin\u2019s memories of subs bombing Sydney in WWII (C8) have certainly triggered some recent trauma,\u201d admits Chris Keane. \u201cA few days ago I was at home in Seattle when my phone started blowing up with messages from \u2018my\u2019 kids in Ukraine. Their previously unscathed city was being actively targeted with Russian missiles and drones. Over the course of a fraught hour I was inundated with messages like \u2018I\u2019m really scared\u2019, \u2018it\u2019s very close, the ground is shaking and everyone is crying\u2019 and \u2018in case I don\u2019t see you again, thanks for everything\u2019. Of course, right now as I write, I\u2019ve started crying again. Perhaps Doug can provide more details about when the nightmares will dissipate?\u201d\n\nThe lobster discussion (C8) goes offshore with former New York knife fancier Ellen Kassel of Collaroy again on point: \u201cHoneymoon \u2013 sailing down Maine. Lobster, lobster, lobster. Day three of honeymoon \u2013 big bad rash all over! Didn\u2019t know which new thing in my life was causing it. Thankfully, it was the lobsters.\u201d",
